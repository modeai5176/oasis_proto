    "content": "Founded in 2023, Oasis & Mirage emerged from a simple observation: in our rapidly changing world, generations often live parallel lives without truly connecting. Our founders, spanning three generations themselves, recognized the profound loss this represents—not just for individuals, but for society as a whole.\n\nWhat started as informal gatherings in community centers has grown into a movement that touches lives across multiple communities. We've learned that when we create the right conditions—respect, curiosity, and genuine care—magic happens. Stories are shared, wisdom is exchanged, and lasting friendships form."
